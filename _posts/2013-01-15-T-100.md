Well we are certainly ready to launch our missile! .. Days seem like enough time.. but we’re sure they will fly by…

Today we are going to tell you about our Objectives! .. well.. the name 101 project is not just because… but starting from the beginning we actually invested some time thinking about the title.. It has to be something significant for us and referent to the project too. So, What is interesting about this project is that it is scheduled to last only 100 days! .. the next one we’ll probably take a deserved vacations.. naa just kiddin … it’d be nice, though… but a job that we enjoy and where we can apport significant ideas would be nicer.. yeah ..

… we ended school… which keeps your calendar organized and somehow you adapt to it, but now we’ve to keep our day organized by ourselves, we have to administrate our time, our job and everything… if we want to learn something else, we have to keep in mind our principal objective… what’s that??… keep using the tools that we know, and discover the new technologies and be updated… use them like a pro… make servers dance when problems come and keep easy codification for who may use it… everything open… we want to share our experience… and welcome experienced people , showing that working together, all its easier… what is the point on having knowledge only for you? … We don’t think there is one…

This also will help us to know how far we can get at the beginning.. I mean, how prepared we are and how  prepared we’ll be for something new, our capability to understand new concepts and adapt it to our needs, and there’s no better way to learn but getting our hands dirty… so let’s work… and make some noise !!

You should know that we are using SCRUM methodology in every reunion that we have referent to the project, we are using also TRELLO to keep track of our missing pieces to complete our goal…  so we are going to keep the update of everything we do with images, graphics, our GitHub code… and we’ll see what else come to our minds… it’s a lot of job and we have no incomes… we hope to learn a lot, but this is not formal education… we want to reveal ourselves as people who can achieve something good in a not common (but modern and effective) way

**… after all.. is there a correct way???**
